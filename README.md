# R Subsetting Bug: Unexpected Behavior with Single-Column/Row Subsets

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in R when subsetting data frames.  The issue arises when a subset operation results in a single column or row.  If the `drop` argument is not explicitly set to `FALSE`, the resulting subset will be coerced to a vector, losing the data frame structure.  This can lead to unexpected results and difficult-to-debug errors in your code.

**The Problem:**

When you subset a data frame using logical indexing (`[` operator), R's default behavior is to drop dimensions that result in only a single column or row. While sometimes convenient, it frequently leads to unexpected errors and can break subsequent operations that rely on the data frame structure. 

**The Solution:**

Always explicitly set the `drop = FALSE` argument in your subsetting operations to preserve the data frame structure, regardless of the number of rows or columns in the result. This ensures consistent behavior and prevents unexpected type coercion.
